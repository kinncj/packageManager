Hey guys!

**Our intention here is to provide a easy-to-use and powerful package manager for php projects hosted at github!**

We want to build a package manager that can search and download any PHP project hosted at github WITHOUT ANY CONFIGURATION.

So here are the possible uses.

`pm search {package-name}`
Searches for public php repos.

`pm download {package-name} {directory}`
Downloads the repository to the current directory, or if specified, to another location.

`pm info {package-name}`
Gets more information about the package.

We will probably have more command, soon.
